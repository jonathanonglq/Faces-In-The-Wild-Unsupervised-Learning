# Faces In The Wild Unsupervised Learning
## Quick Summary 
The primary goal of this project is to design a basic face recognition system. Image classification was done by applying the unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm, which was implemented from scratch, on the centroids of images. In addition, this project investigates other techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and "Eigenfaces", ideas which can significantly improve the efficiency of image classifiation algorithms without significantly compromising model performance.
